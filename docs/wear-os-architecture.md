# Wear OS Architecture

> Committed: 2026-03-09 | Status: Active | Supersedes: Epic 32 original plan

## Design Decision

GlycemicGPT uses a **single phone app + watch-side services** architecture for Wear OS integration. There is NO separate "wear companion" phone app. All watch management is built into the main GlycemicGPT mobile app.

This follows the same pattern used by xDrip, AAPS, Dexcom G7, and other health apps. A separate phone companion app was considered and rejected because:

- Adds unnecessary complexity (inter-app IPC on the same phone)
- Confusing UX (users must install and manage two phone apps)
- The main app already has WearDataSender and DataLayer communication
- Two separate distribution artifacts to maintain
- No technical benefit -- the main app can do everything a companion app would

## Architecture Overview

```
PHONE (Single App)                             WATCH (Wear OS 6+)
+--------------------------------------+      +----------------------------------+
| GlycemicGPT Mobile App (:app)       |      | WFF Watch Face (:watchface)      |
|                                      |      | - Resource-only APK (no code)    |
|  Core Features:                      | Push | - Pushed via Watch Face Push API |
|  - BLE pump/CGM connection           |----->| - Rendered by system WFF engine  |

## Gradle Modules

| Module | Location | Runs On | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| `:app` | `apps/mobile/app/` | Phone | Main app -- everything including watch management UI, WearDataSender, ChannelClient for face push |
| `:wear-device` | `apps/mobile/wear-device/` | Watch | Minimal watch-side services: DataLayer listener, complication providers, WatchFacePushManager |
| `:watchface` | `apps/mobile/watchface/` | Watch | WFF resource-only APK (`hasCode="false"`). Bundled in `:app` assets, pushed to watch via Watch Face Push API |
| `:pump-driver-api` | `plugins/pump-driver-api/` | Phone | Plugin SDK interfaces |
| `:tandem-pump-driver` | `plugins/shipped/tandem/` | Phone | Tandem BLE plugin |

### Key: No separate wear companion phone app

The old `apps/mobile/wear/` module (which was a watch-side app with tiny watch UIs like HomeActivity, ChatActivity) is **removed**. Its watch-side services are migrated to `:wear-device`. Its phone-side functionality is absorbed into `:app`.

## Watch Face Push Flow (Wear OS 6+)

The Watch Face Push API (`androidx.wear.watchface:watchface-push`) enables the phone app to programmatically install and activate WFF watch faces on the watch.

### Initial Setup
1. User installs GlycemicGPT on phone (sideload from GitHub Releases)
2. Watch-side `:wear-device` APK installs on watch (ADB sideload or helper app)
3. User opens Settings > Watch in the phone app
4. App detects connected watch, shows watch face gallery
5. User taps "Set Watch Face" -- app pushes WFF APK via ChannelClient
6. `:wear-device` on watch receives APK, calls `WatchFacePushManager.addWatchFace()`
7. Phone app sends `setWatchFaceAsActive()` -- face appears immediately

### Data Streaming (Real-Time)
1. Main app receives BG/IoB/alerts from pump plugin via BLE
2. `WearDataSender` pushes data items to watch via `DataClient`
3. `:wear-device` `GlycemicDataListenerService` receives data
4. Updates `WatchDataRepository` StateFlows
5. Triggers complication provider updates
6. WFF watch face reads complication data and renders live glucose info

### Watch-to-Phone Communication
1. User taps AI chat or dismisses alert on watch face
2. Watch-side `MessageClient` sends message to phone
3. Phone-side `WearChatRelayService` (in `:app`) receives message
4. Routes to appropriate handler (AI backend, alert service, etc.)
5. Response flows back via DataLayer

## Watch Face Customization

The phone app's Settings > Watch section provides full customization:

### Feature Toggles (synced to watch via DataLayer)
- Show/hide IoB display
- Show/hide glucose graph (sparkline)
- Show/hide alert indicator
- Show/hide seconds in time display
- Graph time range (1h, 3h, 6h)

### Theme Configuration
- Color themes (Dark, Clinical Blue, High Contrast)
- BG color coding thresholds (synced from user's glucose range settings)

### Complication Configuration
- Which data sources are active
- Complication slot assignments

### Watch Face Gallery (Future)
- Multiple WFF face designs to choose from
- Preview before pushing to watch

## Watch-Side Services Detail (`:wear-device`)

### Complication Providers
| Provider | Type | Data |
|----------|------|------|
| `BgColorComplicationDataSource` | SMALL_IMAGE | Color-coded BG bitmap with trend arrow, delta, freshness |
| `GraphComplicationDataSource` | SMALL_IMAGE | Sparkline glucose graph bitmap |
| `IoBComplicationDataSource` | SHORT_TEXT | Insulin on board value |
| `BgComplicationDataSource` | SHORT_TEXT | Plain BG text value |
| `TrendComplicationDataSource` | SHORT_TEXT | Trend arrow symbol |
| `AlertComplicationDataSource` | SHORT_TEXT | Alert status/message |

### Services
| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `GlycemicDataListenerService` | Receives DataLayer events from phone, updates WatchDataRepository, triggers complication refreshes |

### WatchFacePushManager Integration
- Receives WFF APK bytes from phone via ChannelClient
- Calls `addWatchFace()` / `updateWatchFace()` to install
- Handles `setWatchFaceAsActive()` to auto-activate
- Manages face lifecycle (install, update, remove)

## Development vs Production

### Development (Sideloading)

```bash
# Build all modules
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :wear-device:assembleDebug :watchface:assembleDebug

# Install phone app
adb -s <phone> install apps/mobile/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Install watch-side services (via ADB to watch)
adb -s <watch> install apps/mobile/wear-device/build/outputs/apk/debug/wear-device-debug.apk

# Watch face is pushed programmatically by the app (not sideloaded)
# OR for testing: adb -s <watch> install apps/mobile/watchface/build/outputs/apk/debug/watchface-debug.apk
```

### Production (GitHub Releases)

GlycemicGPT is distributed via GitHub Releases (not Play Store -- open source diabetes software, not FDA approved).

- Phone APK and watch APK are published as GitHub Release assets
- Users sideload the phone APK or install via F-Droid (future)
- Watch APK must be installed separately on the watch via ADB or a helper app (Epic 32 future story)
- Watch face is pushed programmatically by the phone app via Watch Face Push API

## API Level Requirements

| Component | minSdk | targetSdk | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| `:app` (phone) | 26 | 35 | Standard Android phone app |
| `:wear-device` (watch) | 33 | 34 | Wear OS 4+ for services/complications. Watch Face Push API requires Wear OS 6 (API 36) at runtime but does not require bumping minSdk. |
| `:watchface` (WFF) | 33 | 34 | WFF v1 for broadest compatibility |

## Migration from Old Architecture

The old `apps/mobile/wear/` module is being replaced by `:wear-device`. Story 32.1 creates the new module and migrates core services. Story 32.9 removes the old module after all functionality is migrated. Migration map:

| Old (wear/) | New Location |
|-------------|-------------|
| `GlycemicDataListenerService` | `:wear-device` |
| `WatchDataRepository` | `:wear-device` |
| `GlucoseDisplayUtils` | `:wear-device` |
| Complication providers (6) | `:wear-device` |
| `HomeActivity` (watch UI) | Removed -- phone Settings > Watch replaces this |
| `ChatActivity` (watch STT) | Removed -- AI interactions go through watch face tap targets |
| `IoBDetailActivity` | Removed -- IoB detail is a complication tap action |
| `AlertsActivity` | `:wear-device` (simplified, launched from watch face tap) |
| `GlycemicTileService` | `:wear-device` (optional, tile alongside watch face) |
| `GlycemicWearApp` (Hilt app) | `:wear-device` |

Phone-side components stay in `:app`:
- `WearDataSender` (already in `:app`)
- `WearChatRelayService` (already in `:app`)
- `WearDataContract` (already in `:app`)
- Settings > Watch UI (enhanced from current stub)
