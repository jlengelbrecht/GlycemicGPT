# Security Testing

How security testing works in the GlycemicGPT CI pipeline, and how to extend it as the platform grows.

## Overview

Security testing has five pillars:

1. **SAST** (`security-scan.yml`, `security-full-suite.yml`) -- Semgrep static analysis on Python, TypeScript, and Kotlin source code. Catches hardcoded secrets, injection patterns, and OWASP Top 10 at the code level.
2. **DAST & Auth Pentests** (`security-scan.yml`, `security-full-suite.yml`) -- behavior-based tests that spin up the Docker stack and attack it: auth flow penetration tests, IDOR prevention, SSRF blocking, OpenAPI-driven API fuzzing, nuclei vulnerability scanning, and OWASP ZAP active injection scanning.
3. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning** (`dependency-scan.yml`) -- OSV-Scanner checks all lockfiles against the OSV database for known CVEs. Runs on every dependency change and weekly on a schedule.
4. **Static Analysis** (CodeRabbit) -- automated PR reviews that check for hardcoded secrets, medical safety violations, BLE protocol issues, and code quality. Configured in `.coderabbit.yaml`.
5. **Full Suite Pentests** (`security-full-suite.yml`) -- comprehensive security scan of the entire platform. Runs on merges to main/develop and manual dispatch. Status badge in README.

### Medical Device Context

GlycemicGPT handles glucose data, insulin pump telemetry, and AI-driven diabetes insights. Security failures in this context can have health consequences. The CI gates enforce a baseline: every PR must pass security checks before merging.

## Two-Workflow Architecture

### PR-Scoped Smart Testing (`security-scan.yml`)

Runs on every PR and push to main/develop. Uses **granular change detection** to only test what actually changed:

| Component | Paths Monitored | What Runs |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| API | `apps/api/**` | Semgrep Python, auth tests, IDOR, SSRF, fuzzer, nuclei API, ZAP API |
| Web | `apps/web/**` | Semgrep TypeScript, nuclei Web, ZAP Web baseline |
| Sidecar | `sidecar/**` | Semgrep TypeScript |
| Mobile | `apps/mobile/**`, `plugins/**` | Semgrep Kotlin |
| Infra | `docker-compose*.yml`, `**/Dockerfile*` | Everything (config changes affect all services) |
| Security | `scripts/security/**`, `.github/workflows/security-scan*` | Everything |

Key optimization: **mobile-only PRs skip the Docker stack entirely** (~2 min vs ~25 min).

### Full Suite Pentests (`security-full-suite.yml`)

Runs everything regardless of what changed. Triggered by:
- Push to main or develop (with 2-hour cooldown to prevent stacking)
- Manual dispatch (bypasses cooldown)

The **cooldown mechanism** prevents waste during rapid merges: if the full suite passed within the last 2 hours, push-triggered runs exit early (~10 seconds). Manual dispatch always bypasses the cooldown. The concurrency group queues (not cancels) pending runs, so at most 1 real run + 1 queued skip exist at any time.

## CI Security Gates

Checks 1-7 run unconditionally on every push/PR from `ci.yml`. Checks 8-10 use a gate job pattern that conditionally skips the heavy work when the PR doesn't touch relevant paths, while still reporting a green check so branch protection is satisfied.

| # | Required Check | Workflow | Triggers On |
|---|----------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Backend Tests | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 2 | Backend Lint | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 3 | Frontend Tests | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 4 | Frontend Lint | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 5 | Attribution Check | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 6 | Sidecar Tests | `ci.yml` | Every push/PR |
| 7 | GitGuardian | External | Every push/PR |
| 8 | Security Scan Gate | `security-scan.yml` | Component-specific (see table above) |
| 9 | Android Gate | `android.yml` | Mobile app/plugin changes |
| 10 | Dependency Scan Gate | `dependency-scan.yml` | Dependency file changes + weekly schedule |

Additionally, the **Security Full Suite** badge on the README reflects the pass/fail status of comprehensive pentests on main.

### Gate Job Pattern (Checks 8-10)

```text
detect-changes  -->  sast (if code changed)     -->  gate (always)
                -->  dast (if Docker needed)     -->
```

- **detect-changes**: Uses `dorny/paths-filter@v3` with 6 granular component filters. Computes derived flags (`needs_sast`, `needs_docker`, `run_all`).
- **sast**: Runs Semgrep on changed components. No Docker stack needed. Runs in parallel with DAST.
- **dast**: Builds Docker stack and runs targeted DAST tests based on which components changed.
- **gate**: Runs `if: always()`. Evaluates both SAST and DAST results. Posts unified PR comment via homebot.0.

## SAST (Static Analysis Security Testing)

**Tool:** [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) with language-specific rulesets.

| Language | Rulesets | Scanned Paths |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Python | `p/python`, `p/owasp-top-ten`, `p/secrets` | `apps/api/`, `scripts/security/` |
| TypeScript | `p/typescript`, `p/owasp-top-ten`, `p/secrets` | `apps/web/`, `sidecar/` |
| Kotlin | `p/kotlin`, `p/android`, `p/secrets` | `apps/mobile/`, `plugins/` |

In the full suite workflow, SARIF results are uploaded to the GitHub Security tab for centralized vulnerability tracking.

## DAST & Auth Penetration Tests

### Test Suites

1. **Auth flow tests** (`test-auth-flows.py`) -- 15 behavior-based tests covering registration, login, token handling, RBAC, and logout.
2. **Data isolation tests** (`test-data-isolation.py`) -- OpenAPI-driven. Auto-discovers ALL endpoints. Tests unauthenticated access (401), CSRF enforcement (403), and cross-user data isolation (IDOR).
3. **Research security tests** (`test-research-security.py`) -- SSRF prevention, rate limiting, source limits, input validation, CSRF enforcement on research endpoints.
4. **API fuzzer** (`fuzz-api.py`) -- OpenAPI-driven. Auto-discovers all endpoints. Sends SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, type confusion, and oversized payloads. Asserts no 500 errors.
5. **Nuclei DAST** -- Known vulnerability templates against API and Web surfaces.
6. **ZAP API active scan** (`zap-api-plan.yaml`) -- Authenticated, OpenAPI-driven injection testing (SQLi, XSS, SSTI, CRLF, path traversal). Auto-discovers all endpoints.
7. **ZAP Web scan** (`zap-web-plan.yaml`) -- Pre-seeds all known page URLs + standard spider + passive/active scanning on the web frontend. Tests security headers, cookie flags, CSP, and injection through the proxy path.

### Auto-discovery

Tests 2, 4, and 6 read `/openapi.json` from the live API to discover endpoints. **New API routes are automatically tested without any test code changes.**

Test 7 pre-seeds all known page URLs from the Next.js app structure and uses the standard spider to discover additional linked pages. (AJAX Spider with headless Firefox was evaluated but risks OOM on standard GitHub runners with 7GB RAM.)

### Test results

Scan results are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts with 30-day retention:
- `sast-results` -- Semgrep JSON/SARIF output
- `dast-results` -- ZAP reports, nuclei JSON, custom test output

## Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/dependency-scan.yml`
**Triggers:** Dependency file changes + weekly Monday 6am UTC schedule + manual dispatch.

### Covered manifests

| Ecosystem | Lockfile | Auto-updated by |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Python (API) | `apps/api/uv.lock` | Renovate |
| Node.js (Web) | `apps/web/package-lock.json` | Renovate |
| Node.js (Sidecar) | `sidecar/package-lock.json` | Renovate |
| Python (Security) | `scripts/security/requirements.txt` | Manual |
| Android (Gradle) | `apps/mobile/gradle/libs.versions.toml` | Renovate (via recursive scan) |

The scanner uses [Google OSV-Scanner](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/) with explicit lockfile paths for Python/Node and recursive scanning for Gradle.

### Handling findings

| Severity | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Critical / High | Block merge, fix immediately | Same PR or hotfix |
| Medium | Create issue, fix in current sprint | 1-2 weeks |
| Low | Triage -- fix if easy, suppress if not exploitable | Best effort |

### Suppressing false positives

Add entries to `osv-scanner.toml` in the repo root:

```toml
[[IgnoredVulns]]
id = "GHSA-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz"
reason = "Not exploitable -- only affects feature X which we don't use"
```

Every suppression must include a reason. Review suppressions quarterly.

## Adding Security Tests for New Integrations

### New API endpoints

**Auto-covered.** The API fuzzer, IDOR tests, and ZAP scan all read `/openapi.json` at runtime. New FastAPI routes with proper type hints are automatically tested. No manual changes needed.

### New web pages

**Auto-covered (full suite).** The ZAP web scan pre-seeds known URLs and uses AJAX Spider to discover new routes. If you add a new page to `apps/web/src/app/`, add its URL to `scripts/security/zap-web-plan.yaml` in the requestor section for guaranteed coverage.

### New auth patterns (OAuth, API keys, webhooks)

**Manual.** Add tests to `scripts/security/test-auth-flows.py`.

### New dependencies

**Manual.** If you add a new ecosystem or lockfile:

1. Add the lockfile path to the `scan` step in `.github/workflows/dependency-scan.yml`.
2. Add the lockfile path to the `detect-changes` filter in the same workflow.
3. Verify the scan runs on the next PR.

### New plugins

**Auto-covered** in most cases:

- **Android Gate**: Plugin code under `plugins/**` triggers the Android build/test/lint pipeline.
- **API fuzzer + ZAP**: If a plugin adds backend API endpoints, they're auto-discovered via `/openapi.json`.
- **SAST**: Kotlin plugin code is scanned by Semgrep with `p/kotlin` and `p/android` rulesets.
- **Dependency scan**: If the plugin adds dependencies to the Gradle version catalog, the recursive scan picks them up.

Only manual action needed: if a plugin introduces a new auth pattern (see above).

## Mobile Security

The Android app has these security measures, verified through different mechanisms:

| Measure | Verification |
|---------|-------------|
| SQLCipher database encryption | Unit tests + CodeRabbit review |
| EncryptedSharedPreferences for tokens | Unit tests + CodeRabbit review |
| HTTPS enforcement (network_security_config) | Android Lint + CodeRabbit review |
| No sensitive data in logs | CodeRabbit BLE Protocol Safety check |
| Dependency vulnerabilities | OSV-Scanner (recursive Gradle scan) |
| Code quality / safety | CodeRabbit Medical Safety Review check |
| Hardcoded secrets, insecure patterns | Semgrep SAST (`p/kotlin`, `p/android`, `p/secrets`) |

No DAST scanning for mobile -- BLE protocol fuzzing would require hardware and is out of scope for CI.
