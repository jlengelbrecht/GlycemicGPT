/**
 * Tests for the reconnection scheduling backoff logic

 *
 * These verify that the tiered reconnection strategy (fast exponential
 * backoff -> slow periodic) behaves correctly.
 *
 * Implementation constants (thresholds, intervals) are private to
 * BleConnectionManager; these tests verify the mathematical properties
 * of the backoff formula rather than asserting constant values.
